# DRIBBLE: An extension to simplify your browsing experience

**Story behind this extension**: I was unfortunately sifting throught many pages of many websites daily looking for my next home. Adverts, as they usually do, and irrelevant results annoy me. So, I came up with the idea to build something that I can tell what to delete for me before my eyes see them ... and that is this item.

**Current status**: The extension is in its first draft, usable by fellow devs and to non-devs with a little dev guidance. The extension is also powered by messy JavaScript. I will look into rewriting it properly so that:
- The JS is cleaner
- The extension can autocalculate CSS selectors and allow users to just pinpoint the elements with their mouse or touch.
